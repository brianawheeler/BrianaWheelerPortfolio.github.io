<!--Challenges:

This has been an amazing journey thus far. Some of my biggest challenges were learning the material, trying to over come 
being a perfectionist and wanting everything I create to look and function its best.

Achievements:

In this process I have learned I really love the front-end aspect of development, and how it allows a lot more creativity.
